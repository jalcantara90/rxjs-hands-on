# RxJS Hands On
This repository contains different scenarios to play with the most common RxJS operators and creator functions.

## Instalation

```bash
  yarn
```

## Execute test suite

```bash
 yarn test
```

## 1. Walkthough through RxJS 
- We will start understanding the design patterns that library uses
```bash
# To execute the files
yarn run:observer
```
- Then we will create our custom RxJS library
```bash
# To execute the files
yarn run:custom-rxjs
```

## 2. Mastering RxJS operators
we are going to play with most common operators of RxJS solving some challenges separated in different concepts in a collaborative way
1. [Creator functions](./src/01-creator-functions/)
2. [Transform operators](./src/02-transform-operators/)
3. [Filtering operatos](./src/03-filtering-operators/)
4. [Combining](./src/04-combining/)

> most of those challenges uses testing marbles [check for more info](https://rxjs.dev/guide/testing/marble-testing) 

## 3. Extreme RxJS challenge (assist under your own risk)
In those sessions we are going to solve a high level challenge using all the things we already learned in the previous sessions in a collaborative way more details soon.
